                <div class="contentContainer">

                    <div class="line-box"><h2>Introduction</h2></div>
                    <div class="sub-topic">
                        <p>This page serves as general outline of pertinent information that applies to a professor's involvement in a general Honor System Investigation. If a professor wishes to learn more about a Faculty Adjudication, please review the Faculty Adjudication page on this website.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="line-box"><h2>Your Role in the Stevens Honor System</h2></div>
                    <div class="sub-topic">
                        <p>The role of a professor is an extremely important one in investigating suspected Honor System violations. Whether the professor was the one to file a report or not, they serve to educate the Honor Board's Investigative Committee on the context of their course. In many instances, the Honor Board relies on the expert opinion of a professor to determine the strength and subtext of key evidence in an investigation.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="line-box"><h2>Reporting a Case</h2></div>
                    <div class="sub-topic">
                        <p>If a professor should come across something suspicious while grading exams/assignments, witness something suspicious during an exam, or even hear of a potential Honor System violation, the Honor Board encourages that professor to file a report. The Honor Board never determines responsibility, it investigates and tries to find out what happened. So, if a professor is unsure whether or not a violation occurred, it is always best to file a report and the Honor Board will determine what actually happened. To report a case, click the "Report A Violation" button on the top of the website and provide as much information as possible.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="line-box"><h2>Involvement in a Case Reported by the Professor</h2></div>
                    <div class="sub-topic">
                        <p>After reporting a case, the Honor Board appoints an Investigative Committee Chair to lead the investigation as well as an Investigative Committee Assistant. This IC Team will soon reach out to the professor that reported the case in order to review the evidence with the professor. The evidence the IC Team might need for an investigation could be, but is not limited to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The Exam/Assignment in Question</li>
                            <li>A Seating Chart</li>
                            <li>Copy of the Course's Syllabus</li>
                            <li>Any Canvas Activity from the Time of the Suspected Violation</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The professor may also be asked to testify at a hearing by the IC Team. The professor is not required to testify and should only do so if they feel comfortable doing so. If not, the meeting minutes the IC Team had with the professor should be sufficient evidence. After the meeting, the IC Team will move forward with the investigation from there and continue to keep the professor updated as the case progresses. The professor will be included in the official Investigation Notification and the Case Outcome Notification emails to the Accused Student as well.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="line-box"><h2>Involvement in a Case Not Reported by the Professor</h2></div>
                    <div class="sub-topic">
                        <p>The only difference between the professor's involvement in a case they reported and a case they did not report is only knowing about it in advance. Upon receiving a report about a suspected violation, the Honor Board's IC Team will attempt to hold a meeting to review all of the potential evidence in a case. The professor's expert opinion on certain evidence will be a heavy determining factor in whether or not the Honor Board opens an investigation against a student.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="line-box"><h2>Testifying at a Hearing</h2></div>
                    <div class="sub-topic">
                        <p>The Honor Board never determines a student's responsibility for a suspected violation. Therefore, if a student decides not to confess to a given violation, the case will proceed to a hearing. A professor's testimony is greatly helpful, as it provides a convincing account of the evidence, given the professor's expert opinion on the evidence. If the professor decides to testify, they will be informed of the time and date of the hearing. Upon arriving to the witness room on the day of the hearing, they will wait for the bailiff to escort them to the hearing chamber. They will be asked questions from both the Investigative Committee Chair and the Accused Student. Afterwards, the Hearing will continue, but the professor cannot stay.</p>
