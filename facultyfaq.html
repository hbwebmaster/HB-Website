        <h1>Faculty Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
        <br/>
        <div class="faq-container">
            <h2>If I caught a student obviously cheating on an exam, does it have to be reported to the Honor Board? What if they are already failing the class?</h2>
                <p>Yes, all incidents must be reported to the Honor Board, no matter
                how obvious and regardless of the student’s current or projected
                grade in the class. For a Faculty Adjudication case, the results of
                those investigations must also be reported to the Honor Board. This
                is because a record needs to be kept of all violations to ensure that
                recurring violations from the same student(s) are treated with the
                proper magnitude.</p>

            <hr>

            <h2>If a student confesses to me about cheating on an exam, why can I not simply give them a zero?</h2>
                <p>Stevens firmly believes that students caught cheating should receive
                similar penalties to others who have committed the same violation in
                the past. Additionally, all students have a right to a complete
                investigation through an unbiased third-party (the Honor Board),
                regardless of the circumstances surrounding the individual incident.</p>

            <hr>

            <h2>When can I submit a suspected violation as a Faculty Adjudication?</h2>
                <p>Faculty Adjudications are an alternative for simply reporting a case for a professor with a suspicion about a potential Honor System violation. Only the professor of a course can submit a faculty adjudication, not a TA or CA.</p>

            <hr>

            <h2>How do I perform a faculty adjudication?</h2>
                <p>First, collect all information that you believe is relevant to the
                    incident, such as an exam, seating chart, Canvas activity
                    information, or other details. Then, download the Faculty
                    Adjudication Report Handbook <a href="documents/faculty-adjudication-form.pdf">here</a>,
                    review and follow the guidelines, and complete the form at the end with the accused student. Be certain to add the student’s name, the violation, and the recommended penalty, which should fall within the Honor Board’s established Penalty Matrix found <a href="documents/penalty-matrix.pdf">here</a>. If they do sign the Form, please submit it to the Honor Board at honor@stevens.edu, along with all supporting documents that you had collected. The Honor Board will then vote on the penalty for approval at its next General Body Meeting, and you and the student will receive a Case Outcome Notification from the Honor Board with the finalized penalty, officially closing the incident. For more information, please see the Faculty Adjudication page found <a href='facultyadjudication.html'>here</a>. If a student refuses to sign a Faculty Adjudication Report Form, please submit the incident to the Honor Board for a full investigation.</p>

            <hr>

            <h2>Where should I be during an exam?</h2>
                <p>The Honor System does not allow excessive proctoring of exams.
                Excessive proctoring is defined as excessively watching, hovering
                over, or otherwise making students feel uncomfortable during an
                exam. Professors are encouraged to be present in an exam room to
                answer student questions or to aid in exam administration.
                Regarding seating, you may request students to space themselves
                out as much as possible within an exam room, but you may not
                assign students to specific seats. You may also request that
                students leave their cell phones at the front of the exam room, and
                place their backpacks against a wall, away from the students. </p>

            <hr>

            <h2>I have been made aware that some students have a substantial collection of previous exams I have administered. What do you recommend that I do?</h2>
                <p>Regardless of efforts to prevent students from passing along old
                exams to peers, it is inevitable that some will surface. Therefore, the
                Honor Board recommends that you make these exams available to
                all students to level the playing field for the entire class. The Honor
                Board also strongly advocates substantial changing of exams
                between class years to ensure accurate assessment of student
                knowledge.</p>
