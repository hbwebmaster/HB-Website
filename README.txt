Welcome to the Honor Board website fellow Webmaster or otherwise tech savvy individual!!!!
The purpose of this README file is to introduce you to the inner workings of our w3honor folder and all its folders and pages!

audio:
Folder for audio files on the website. Currently contains only the theme music for Cop Steve.

documents:
The one-stop shop for all your document needs. Basically a folder of all the document pdfs. Contains folder of older versions of documents in case of tracking backwards on when a specific change or revision may have occurred. 

images:
Hey you! Yeah, you! You like pictures? If so, then the images folder is for you! This folder contains every image and icon on the website as well as the bio pictures for each member on the membership page. I'd say all the members on the Board, but some still haven't gotten back to me with their information...

new:
Testing, testing, 1, 2, 3. The new folder contains an exact copy of the website for testing and adding new content. It is recommended to make any edits to the website within the new folder first to see how the Stevens server environment handles it. Trust me, this is a valuable resource as our server is a fickle one.

old:
This folder contains the OLD old version of the website. Keeping it for mostly a reference to how we used to present ourselves and out of nostalgia

scripts:
This folder contains the JavaScript files for the quote slides in the website's footer as well as the precious memes on the membership page.

styles:
What kind of a website would we be without a little style in our lives? In this folder you'll find the main css files for both the website and the mobile version of the website

video:
As the name implies, this folder contains the video we show to the Freshman at Convocation, as well as displayed on our home page.

about.html:
This time on How It's Made, we explore the Stevens Honor System. Yeah, on the website it's both linked as the About page and the How It Works page, but if we're being honest here even I don't know how that works. But it does, and this page makes sense of it.

accusedguide.html:
Have you been accused of an Honor System violation? Are you thinking of filing a lawsuit because we caught you cheating? Well, take a look at our Guide page and maybe you'll realize that the Honor Board isn't so bad. Hopefully, this guide page accomplishes just that reaction. Otherwise, they'll tell their mom on us and our mom will then have to get involved. It's a whole thing.

calendar.html: 
Currently not linked on the webpage. This served as a testing page for the Google calendar linked to the honorboardweb@gmail.com account. Has potential, but like all works in progress, work needs to progress.

documents.html:
The newly refurbished documents page serves to provide access to our documents. If you think it's pretty self-explanatory, then hey you're catching on!

ethicscourse.html:
For all the students that have talked to their ICC, PA, and read the Ethics Course Manual and still didn't understand it, we have the Ethics Course Web Page! It basically explains the same thing again!

facultyadjudication.html: 
This page serves to explain what a Faculty Adjudication is and how it is implemented. From my experience talking to professor's about adjudications, this page receives very little traffic.

facultyfaq.html:
The generalized questions any faculty may have, but answered!

faq.html:
Currently unlinked on the website as well, this page combines both the student FAQs and the faculty FAQs into one. This used to be the FAQ page, but I split it up to make it easier to read.

index.html:
The home page of our glorious website! This page contains the hidden link to the Internal page (The "INT" in Integrity), the video, the president's stance on us, and the latest Instagram post (must be updated manually).

internal.html:
The Not-So-Secret Internal page for submitting case updates, notifying the E-Board of a PA meeting, and a GBM Absence Form

juryguide.html:
This page serves to highlight the wonders of being a jury member at a hearing. Hopefully, more people don't blow off hearings in the future.

membership.html: 
The central hub of the Honor Board's hidden easter eggs! Oh, it also describes the members of the Honor Board, but hey we all know we're here for the memes.

menu.html:
This page exists solely for traversing the website on a mobile device. It serves as the menu. Bootleg fix, I know, but hey it works!

profguide.html:
Any and all information a professor may need for helping out the Honor Board in investigations. 

README.txt:
Hey wait, this is the file I'm currently editing/reading. Dude, so meta.

studentfaq.html:
Throwback to when I was describing the previous faq pages, but this time it's all about the students.

template.html:
This page serves to create the skeleton of any future web pages the Board may need. Spoopy, I know!
