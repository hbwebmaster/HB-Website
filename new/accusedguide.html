                <div class="contentContainer">

                    <div class="line-box"><h2>Introduction</h2></div>
                    <div class="sub-topic">
                        <p>This page serves as general outline of pertinent information that can all be found within the Accused Student Informational Handbook attached within the Investigation Notification, and also found <a href="documents/accused-student-handbook.pdf">here</a>.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="line-box"><h2>The Investigation Notification</h2></div>
                    <div class="sub-topic">
                        <p>The Investigation Notification, or IN, serves to make an accused student aware that they are under investigation for an Honor System violation. Read this email carefully, as it presents the important details of a student's case. More specifically, within the IN you will find:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The course in which the suspected violation occured.</li>
                            <li>The case number that represents the specific investigation conducted by the Honor Board</li>
                            <li>The Type of Violation, or Charge.</li>
                            <li>The name of the Investigative Committee Chair(ICC) assigned to the case.</li>
                            <li>The name of the Procedural Adviser(PA) assigned to the student.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <div class="line-box"><h2>After the Investigation Notification</h2></div>
                    <div class="sub-topic">
                        <p>Following the IN, an accused student should expect to be contacted by the Investigative Committee Chair. The Investigative Committee (IC) will wish to hold an investigatory meeting to discuss case details with the student. Unfortunately, the IC team will be unable to discuss any details or specifics surrounding a student's case via email. Thus, an accused student will learn all the information about their case upon meeting with the IC team.</p>
                        <p>The accused student should also expect to receive an email from their Procedural Advisor after receiving the IN. The PA will not request a meeting with the accused student, but will offer to meet with the student should they want a meeting. The inital email from a PA serves to introduce themselves to the student and offer initial guidance.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="line-box"><h2>Initial Investigatory Meeting</h2></div>
                    <div class="sub-topic">
                        <p>The initial investigatory meeting between an IC team and the accused student serves as a way for the IC team to present the evidence of the accused student's suspected violation. The job of the Investigative Committee is to determine what happened. They do not accuse any students, but simply gather evidence and present it. The IC team will also review the possible case outcomes for the student's case and give a rough timeline for the duration of the case.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="line-box"><h2>The Role of the Procedural Adviser</h2></div>
                    <div class="sub-topic">
                        <p>The Procedural Advisor serves as the student's personal guide. The PA is an Honor Board member, thus they have experience with Honor System violations and Honor Board case procedure. However, anything discussed via email or in person with the PA stays completely confidential between the PA and the accused student. It is highly recommeneded that an accused student utilize the Procedural Adviser for any guidance throughout the entirety of their case. If a case proceeds to a hearing, the Procedural Adviser will be available for preparation work as well as attending the hearing and making sure the student's rights are defended. If a student should be assigned a penalty of an ethics course, the PA will serve as the ethics course mentor for the student. Overall, this person is a valuable asset to the accused student.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="line-box"><h2>Case Outcomes</h2></div>
                    <div class="sub-topic">
                        <p>The Honor Board will never determine whether or not an accused student is responsible of an Honor System violation. Instead, either the accused student accepts responsibility or is decided responsible by a jury of other Stevens students. Specifically, there are four potential outcomes for an Honor Board investigation:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Confession Form: If an accused student would like to accept responsibility for an Honor System violation, they request a confession form to sign. Upon signing, the IC team will then present all the evidence to the rest of the Honor Board and determine a penalty. The student will then be notified of the penalty via a Case Outcome Notification.</li>
                            <li>Stipulated Confession Form: Similar to a confession form, the stipulated confession form is requested from the student. Upon its request, the IC team will present the evidence of the case to the Honor Board, determine a penalty, and then meet with the accused student again to present the form with the penalty stated on the form. However, if a student signs a stipulated confession form and accepts responsibility, they will be unable to file an appeal based on harshness of penalty.</li>
                            <li>Case Drop: If the IC team determines that there is not enough evidence for a case, they will present the case in its entirety and if the Board votes that there isn't enough evidence, the case against the accused student will be dropped.</li>
                            <li>Hearing: If the accused student does not wish to accept responsibility and the ICC decides to not drop the case, it will proceed to a hearing. At a hearing both the ICC and accused student will be able to present their evidence and call upon any witnesses before a jury of unbiased Stevens students. After the presentation of evidence, the jury will then deliberate and decide whether or not the accused student is responsible of the suspected violation. If they are determined responsible, the Honor Board will vote upon and determine a penalty. If they are determined not responsible, the case will be dropped.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </div>

                    <div class="line-box"><h2>Expediting a Case</h2></div>
                    <div class="sub-topic">
                        <p>The Honor Board strongly cautions against signing a confession form to "get it over with". Signing a confession form means accepting responsiblity for a violation, not ending an Honor System investigation. The best way to expedite an Honor Board investigation is to be cooperative with the IC team in setting up and attending the necessary investigatory meetings.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="line-box"><h2>Confidentiality</h2></div>
                    <div class="sub-topic">
                        <p>A key important aspect of the Honor System is confidentiality. All information and case-related details discussed remain confidential within the Honor Board and its advisors. No Board member is permitted to discuss any case-related information to anyone else outside of the Honor Board. An accused student's information is their's to do with what they will. However, the Honor Board cautions against discussing a case with anyone besides their assigned IC team and PA, mainly for maintaining their integrity in Stevens academia and preventing the flow of misinformation. </p>
