        <br/>
        <div class="line-box"><h2>Students</h2></div>
        <div class="faq-container">
            
            <h2>If I do not sign the pledge or word it correctly on an assignment, am I safe from an Honor System violation?</h2>
                <p>The Honor System requires that undergraduate students sign the
                pledge on all submitted work (tests, quizzes, projects, code, etc.). If
                the pledge is not initially present on an assignment, the course
                instructor will take the omission as an unintentional mistake and ask
                that you submit the signed pledge. If you refuse to sign the pledge at
                this stage, it will be taken as an admission of responsibility for an
                Honor System violation, and the professor can report the case to the
                Honor Board.</p>
            <hr>

            <h2>Is it acceptable to use a stamp of the pledge in lieu of writing it out?</h2>
                <p>Yes, a stamp or a typed version of the pledge is acceptable in place
                of a handwritten pledge. A valid signature must be included. For a
                typed assignment, typing one’s name is an acceptable alternative to
                a handwritten signature.</p>
            <hr>
            
            <h2>Should tutors or classmates be listed as references on homework and assignments?</h2>
                <p>Yes. When the professor allows collaboration, even working with classmates counts as aid and must be referenced on the assignment.</p>
            <hr>
            
            <h2>My professor has accused me of cheating, and decided to fail
            me or give me a zero on the assignment. What should I do?</h2>
                <p>Report the situation to the Honor Board. The incident will be
                investigated by the Honor Board. Professors may only investigate
                potential violations through the Faculty Adjudication process.</p>
            <hr>
            
            <h2>What is a Faculty Adjudication? How does the process work?</h2>
                <p>If a professor suspects that you may have committed an Honor
                System violation, the professor may approach you about their
                suspicions and discuss the matter directly with you. You and your
                professor may mutually come to a decision on a penalty, and the
                faculty member must submit a completed Faculty Adjudication
                Report Form found <a href="documents/faculty-adjudication-form.pdf">here</a> to the Honor Board. The Honor Board
                will then vote to approve the Faculty Adjudication and the student
                and professor will receive a Case Outcome Notification to indicate
                the closure of the incident. Please note that the Honor Board
                reserves the right to open a full investigation on behalf of the student
                if it believes that there was improper conduct throughout the
                process. Additionally, the Honor Board may modify the agreed-upon
                penalty if it does not fall within the established Penalty Matrix found <a href="documents/penalty-matrix.pdf">here</a>.</p>
            <hr>
            
            <h2>My professor approached me regarding a faculty adjudication, but I didn’t do anything wrong or the penalty is too harsh. Can the Honor Board investigate?</h2>
                <p>Yes. As long as you did not sign agreeing to the penalty, you can report your case to the Honor Board, at which point it is out of the professor’s hands.If you did sign the Faculty Adjudication Report
                Form, please contact the Honor Board and the case may still be
                reopened in certain circumstances, determined on a case-by-case
                basis.</p>
            <hr>
            
            <h2>I think I saw my classmate cheating during an exam, but I’m not sure. Should I report it, and if so, how?</h2>
                <p>Yes, even if you’re not sure, it’s your responsibility to report anything you see. The Honor Board will investigate further and determine if there is evidence of a violation. You can report all violations on the Honor System website by clicking “Report a Violation” or by clicking “Report a Concern” on your MyStevens homepage.</p>
            <hr>
            
            <h2>I am being investigated for an Honor System violation. Am I allowed to consult with my friend who is on the Honor Board?</h2>
                <p>Any case details will be restricted to meetings with the investigative
                committee (ICC and ICA) assigned to the case, who have no
                personal ties to involved students to avoid a conflict of interest.
                However, a Procedural Advisor (PA) will be assigned to you to
                answer any questions you may have about how the Honor System
                operates. You may also consult the Honor Board’s Advisors, Dean
                Berkley (dberkley@stevens.edu), Dr. Linda Beninghove
                (lbeningh@stevens.edu), or Director Xhijola Ruçi
                (xruci@stevens.edu).</p>
            <hr>
            
            <h2>As an undergraduate student, does the Honor System
            apply in my graduate courses?</h2>
                <p>Yes. Undergraduates enrolled in 500-level courses are subject to the
                Honor System in exactly the same way as 400-level and lower
                courses. Cases function in the same manner, with an investigative
                committee, procedural advisor, and potential case outcomes of a
                case drop, confession, stipulated confession, and hearing. Students
                in 600-level and higher courses are considered graduate students in
                that course, and therefore are subject to the Graduate Code of
                Academic Integrity.</p>
            <hr>
            
            <h2>What is an Academic Sanction? What is a Removable
            Academic Sanction, and how can it be removed?</h2>
                <p>An Academic Sanction is a mark on a student’s transcript next to a
                course indicating that the student was found responsible of an
                Honor System violation in that course. An Academic Sanction is
                removed upon a student’s graduation from Stevens or departure
                from the University. If the Honor Board assigns a Removable
                Academic Sanction, the transcript mark can be removed prior to
                graduation by completing a task, which is typically a version of the
                Ethics Course (the specifics are detailed in a student’s individual
                Case Outcome Notification). If a student completes their assigned
                task in the period of time allotted on a Case Outcome Notification,
                the Honor Board will inform the Honor Board Advisor to confer with
                the Office of the Registrar to remove the Academic Sanction, a
                process which is typically completed within 1 (one) week of the
                request.</p>
            <hr>
        
            <h2>After an Academic Sanction has been removed, is
            there any trace that I had it?</h2>
                <p>No. A student’s transcript and official records will not indicate an
                Honor System violation. If an employer, graduate school, or other
                entity requests records relating to academic misconduct from
                Stevens, the student will first be contacted to request permission for
                the Honor Board to release this information. If the student permits
                the release of the information, an Honor Board Advisor will contact
                the Honor Board for a student’s case history and will provide that
                information to the requesting organization or entity.</p>
            <hr>
            
            <h2>What is an Ethics Course?</h2>
                <p>The Ethics Course is an Honor Board-designed independent study
                course that is meant to serve as a way for a student found
                responsible for an Honor System violation to reflect on the incident
                and the importance of academic integrity. The Ethics Course
                includes four Tiers assigned based upon the severity of the incident,
                and other mitigating and aggravating factors. Each Tier includes a
                set of tasks which must be completed within a specified time frame.
                Ethics Courses are most often used as a method to remove a
                Removable Academic Sanction (as described above).</p>
            <hr>
            
            <h2>Can I appeal the results of an Honor Board investigation after I took responsibility or was found responsible of a violation?</h2>
                <p>Yes. You may appeal the outcome of an investigation to the
                Committee on Academic Appeals if you believe the Honor Board did
                not properly follow procedure or the assigned penalty was too harsh.
                If you signed a Stipulated Confession Form, you may not appeal on
                the grounds of the penalty’s harshness. In order to initiate an
                appeal, please follow the instructions listed in your Case Outcome
                Notification.</p>
            <hr>
            
            <h2>What are some examples of penalties levied by the Honor Board?</h2>
                <p>Honor Board penalties typically fall within three categories: grade
                changes, Academic Sanctions, and suspensions or expulsions.
                Grade changes typically range from partial credit on an assignment
                to failure in a course. Academic Sanctions are described in detail
                above. Suspensions typically range from one-semester to one-year,
                based upon the individual case. For consistency, the Honor Board
                references its established Penalty Matrix (found <a href="documents/penalty-matrix.pdf">here</a>) whenever voting on
                a penalty. Assigned penalties typically fall within the range of the
                Matrix, however case-specific circumstances may cause an
                assigned penalty to fall outside of the recommended range.</p>
            <hr>
            
            <h2>Should I take responsibility for a violation if I know I’m responsible?</h2>
                <p>Yes. The student-run Honor System relies on students holding
                themselves and others accountable. Being honest about an incident
                is extremely helpful to Honor Board investigators.</p>
            <hr>
            
            <h2>Should I take responsibility for the violation if I know I'm not responsible?</h2>
                <p>No. Only ever admit responsibility for a violation if you actually
                committed the violation. The Honor System’s procedures are in
                place in order to limit situations in which students are found
                responsible for violations they did not commit. Being honest about
                an incident is extremely helpful to Honor Board investigators.</p>
            <hr>

            <h2>What are potential case outcomes for Honor System investigations?</h2>
                <p>An Honor Board investigation has four potential outcomes: case
                drop, confession, stipulated confession, and hearing. A case drop
                occurs when the Honor Board feels there is not substantive
                evidence to pursue the case further and votes to drop the case at a
                General Body Meeting. A confession occurs when a student admits
                responsibility for a violation. The Honor Board votes on a penalty
                based on established precedent and the Penalty Matrix and
                confers the assigned penalty to the student and professor via a
                Case Outcome Notification. A stipulated confession is a confession
                form with a pre-determined penalty voted upon by the Honor Board
                listed. This enables a student to know the penalty that will be
                assigned to them prior to admitting responsibility. A student’s
                requesting of a stipulated confession does not imply responsibility.
                Upon signing the Stipulated Confession Form, a student is admitting
                responsibility for an Honor System violation and will receive a Case
                Outcome Notification with the penalty that was listed on the Form.
                Finally, a hearing results when a student does not admit
                responsibility for a violation, and the Honor Board feels there is
                substantive evidence to pursue the case. Hearings are explained
                below.</p>
            <hr>

            <h2>What is an Honor System hearing?</h2>
                <p>If a student does not admit responsibility for an Honor System
                violation, and the Honor Board feels there is enough evidence to
                pursue a case, a hearing will be scheduled. Prior to the hearing, a
                randomized jury call will be sent to members of the Stevens
                undergraduate community calling for their participation in the
                hearing proceedings. Of these students, eight will be selected to
                hear a case, in which both the accused student and the Honor
                Board investigators will have the opportunity to speak to the
                evidence collected throughout an investigation. Six of the eight
                jurors will then enter deliberation and render a unanimous verdict
                of Responsible or Not Responsible for the Honor System violation.</p>
            <hr>
            
            <h2>If I witness a violation, how long do I have to report it?</h2>
                <p>Students, faculty, teaching assistants, and other community
                members can report an Honor System violation within fifteen business days of the suspected violation’s occurrence. Any reports made more than fifteen business days after an incident occurred may only be investigated by a three-fourths majority of the Honor Board at its next General Body Meeting.</p>
            <hr>

            <h2>If I caught a student obviously cheating on an exam, does it have to be reported to the Honor Board? What if they are already failing the class?</h2>
                <p>Yes, all incidents must be reported to the Honor Board, no matter
                how obvious and regardless of the student’s current or projected
                grade in the class. For a Faculty Adjudication case, the results of
                those investigations must also be reported to the Honor Board. This
                is because a record needs to be kept of all violations to ensure that
                recurring violations from the same student(s) are treated with the
                proper magnitude.</p>

            <h2>If a student confesses to me about cheating on an exam, why can I not simply give them a zero?</h2>
                <p>Stevens firmly believes that students caught cheating should receive
                similar penalties to others who have committed the same violation in
                the past. Additionally, all students have a right to a complete
                investigation through an unbiased third-party (the Honor Board),
                regardless of the circumstances surrounding the individual incident.</p>

            <hr>
            
            <h2>When can I submit a suspected violation as a Faculty Adjudication?</h2>
                <p>Faculty Adjudications are an alternative for simply reporting a case for a professor with a suspicion about a potential Honor System violation. Only the professor of a course can submit a faculty adjudication, not a TA or CA.</p>
            
            <hr>
            
            <h2>How do I perform a faculty adjudication?</h2>
                <p>First, collect all information that you believe is relevant to the
                    incident, such as an exam, seating chart, Canvas activity
                    information, or other details. Then, download the Faculty
                    Adjudication Report Handbook <a href="documents/faculty-adjudication-form.pdf">here</a>,
                    review and follow the guidelines, and complete the form at the end with the accused student. Be certain to add the student’s name, the violation, and the recommended penalty, which should fall within the Honor Board’s established Penalty Matrix found <a href="documents/penalty-matrix.pdf">here</a>. If they do sign the Form, please submit it to the Honor Board at honor@stevens.edu, along with all supporting documents that you had collected. The Honor Board will then vote on the penalty for approval at its next General Body Meeting, and you and the student will receive a Case Outcome Notification from the Honor Board with the finalized penalty, officially closing the incident. For more information, please see the Faculty Adjudication page found <a href='facultyadjudication.html'>here</a>. If a student refuses to sign a Faculty Adjudication Report Form, please submit the incident to the Honor Board for a full investigation.</p>

            <h2>Where should I be during an exam?</h2>
                <p>The Honor System does not allow excessive proctoring of exams.
                Excessive proctoring is defined as excessively watching, hovering
                over, or otherwise making students feel uncomfortable during an
                exam. Professors are encouraged to be present in an exam room to
                answer student questions or to aid in exam administration.
                Regarding seating, you may request students to space themselves
                out as much as possible within an exam room, but you may not
                assign students to specific seats. You may also request that
                students leave their cell phones at the front of the exam room, and
                place their backpacks against a wall, away from the students. </p>

            <hr>

            <h2>I have been made aware that some students have a substantial collection of previous exams I have administered. What do you recommend that I do?</h2>
                <p>Regardless of efforts to prevent students from passing along old
                exams to peers, it is inevitable that some will surface. Therefore, the
                Honor Board recommends that you make these exams available to
                all students to level the playing field for the entire class. The Honor
                Board also strongly advocates substantial changing of exams
                between class years to ensure accurate assessment of student
                knowledge.</p>

        <div class="faq-container">
            <h2>If I caught a student obviously cheating on an exam, does it have to be reported to the Honor Board? What if they are already failing the class?</h2>
                <p>Yes. All violations must be reported to the Honor Board, no matter how obvious and regardless of the student’s current or projected grade in the class. The only exception is faculty adjudication (see below), and even then the result of the adjudication must be submitted to the Honor Board. The reason being that a record needs to be kept of all violations to be sure that recurring violations are treated with the proper magnitude.</p>
            
            <hr>
            
            <h2>If a student confesses to me about cheating on an exam, why can I not simply give them a zero?</h2>
                <p>Stevens believes in a fair system such that a student caught cheating not only has the right to an investigation and hearing, but also that he/she will receive a similar penalty as other students who committed the the same violation in the past. Because of this, all violations must be investigated and penalized through the Honor Board, regardless of the circumstances.</p>

            <hr>
            
            <h2>When can I submit a suspected violation as a Faculty Adjudication?</h2>
                <p>Faculty Adjudications are reserved only for small assignments, defined as anything worth 13 percent or less of the final grade in the course.</p>
            
            <hr>
            
            <h2>How do I perform a faculty adjudication?</h2>
                <p>Download the faculty adjudication form from the Honor Board’s website and fill it out. Make sure to add the student’s name, the violation, and the penalty. The penalty *must* be within the guidelines set by the Honor Board’s penalty matrix. Then meet with the student and ask them about the suspected violation. If they sign the faculty adjudication form admitting to the violation and agreeing to the penalty, you can then send it in to the Honor Board through e-mail to honor@stevens.edu or hand it in to one of our advisors, Dean Berkley on the 10th floor of Howe or Kurtis Watkins on the 7th floor of Howe.</p>

            <hr>
            
            <h2>What happens if a student does not sign my faculty adjudication form?</h2>
                <p>If a student refuses to sign, either because they deny the violation or they think the penalty is too harsh, you should report the violation to the Honor Board as if it was a traditional violation, i.e., not a faculty adjudication. The Honor Board will perform a thorough investigation and assign a penalty if the student confesses or is convicted.</p>
            
            <hr>

            <h2>Where should I be during an exam?</h2>
                <p>Since the Honor System does not allow proctoring, you cannot be actively observing the exam. There are some cases where it is allowable to be in the exam room, but the best option is to just wait in a nearby office or other room for the duration of the exam. Make sure students know where you will be and remain available for any students who were given valid extensions for the exam’s ending time.</p>

            <hr>

            <h2>It has come to my attention that some students in the class have a substantial collection of previous year’s tests. What do you recommend?</h2>
                <p>Regardless of any efforts to prevent students from passing along old exams to their subsequent classmates, it is inevitable that some will surface. Therefore, the Honor Board recommends making these exams available to all students. By doing this, it levels the playing field for the entire class. The Honor Board also strongly advocates professors not using the same test multiple times.</p>
